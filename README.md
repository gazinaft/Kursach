<h1>Plans</h1>

I intend to make at least 2 games: <b>snake</b> with some assistance from the book and <b>tetris</b> all by myself

If I have enough time and inspiration I`ll make the third one using Open GL ES, supposedly a platformer 

<h1>Quick review of a code structure</h1>

The framework that was used to create these games is located in a `framework` folder.
The interfaces are located in this folder and their implementations are in `impl` folder

The source code for the Snake game is located in `snake` folder

The source code for tetris is located in `tetris` folder

And the source code for the third game is located in `platformer` folder
