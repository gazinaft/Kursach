# Kursach
<h1> Short description</h1>

This is my course work for programming basics in KPI

The theme of this assignment is an Android game framework written in Kotlin and a game written with its help

The game is written using an almoust self-written framework with help of
<a href = "https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=mario+zechner+beginning+android+games">this book<a/>

<h1>Plans</h1>

I intend to make at least 2 games: <b>snake</b> with some assistance from the book and <b>tetris</b> all by myself

If I have enough time and inspiration I`ll make the third one using Open GL ES, supposedly a platformer 

<h1>Quick review of a code structure</h1>

The framework that was used to create these games is located in a `framework` folder.
The interfaces are located in this folder and their implementations are in `impl` folder

The source code for the Snake game is located in `snake` folder

The source code for tetris is located in `tetris` folder

And the source code for the third game is located in `platformer` folder

<h1>Current State</h1>
The framework and the snake are fully completed

Tetris is 2 days from implementation

And the platformer game has only the foundation of <a href = "https://www.gamedev.net/articles/programming/general-and-gameplay-programming/understanding-component-entity-systems-r3013/">component-entity system </a>
