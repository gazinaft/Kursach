# Kursach
<h1> Short description</h1>

This is my course work for programming basics in KPI

The theme of this assignment is an Android game written in Kotlin

The game is written using an almoust self-written framework with help of
<a href = "https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=mario+zechner+beginning+android+games">this book<a/>

<h1>Plans</h1>



I intend to make at least 2 games: <b>snake</b> with some assistance from the book and <b>tetris</b> all by myself

If I have enough time and inspiration I`ll make the third one using Open GL ES, supposedly a platformer 

<h2>P.S.</h2>


Readme will be updated after successful implementation of the snake game
